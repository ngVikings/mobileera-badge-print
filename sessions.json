You will learn about approaches for internationalization and about modern authentication scenarios with OAuth 2 and OpenId Connect that allow for single sign on as well as for an integration into existing identity systems like Active Directory. In addition to that, you will also get to know some strategies to drastically improve your application performance, like using observables and immutables for data binding and leveraging the AOT compiler as well as tree shaking. In addition to that, you will find out how to use lazy loading and preloading together with webpack and how to use other advanced routing techniques, like aux routes, router events and guards.<br /><b><a href='https://ti.to/ngvikings/2017/with/8cwlwg1x4qm'>Get the ticket</a></b>",

And of course CODING! We do this by switching theory with coding sessions where you have to code parts of the application yourself. We refactor a non-reactive application towards a reactive application during the workshop.

    "description": "I’ll take you through a journey of the web browser history, and provide with a perspective on how the web apps of the future will look like in a world, that's increasingly dominated by mobile devices, and constrained by new challenges such as limited power, battery and connectivity. The web and the apps you build today will continue to be relevant, but maybe in a different way from what you expect today. Who knows, maybe browser you use today won’t exist in the future.",

    "title": "Migrating Applications from Angular 1 to Angular 2",
    "description": "Your Angular 1 application doesn’t have to be scrapped, or live forever. There’s another way. Migration from Angular 1 to the latest version of Angular is a great way to add life to your application without spending an unreasonable amount of time and money on “the great rewrite”. Come learn from Joe Eames how to migrate your application to to save time, money, and minimize risk. In this workshop attendees will migrate a production-ready application to the latest version of Angular, and learn a step by step plan for migrating any application from Angular 1.x, including: preparing your Angular 1.x application for migration, minimizing risk through small steps, dealing with third party libraries, effectively migrating routing, including protecting routes & preloading data, dealing with HTTP, and learning common gotchas when migrating from 1.x.",
